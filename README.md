# Detection and Prevention of Various Cyber Attacks on Mobile Network

## INTRODUCTION

With a global increase in dependence on digital devices, there has also been a global increase in incidents of cyber-attacks on these devices, and with respect to such incidents, India has been no exception. Hence, it is the need of the hour to have a system in place that will not only detect but also ward off such attacks.
Smartphones connected to a network are vulnerable to a number of security threats such as malware that can easily breach the defense systems of IOS and Androids. Hence, an in-build strong defense mechanism is crucial to protect security breaches and prevent data and monetary thefts. Solely solutions capable of analyzing behavior at every layer for indications of attacks can protect the devices effectively. Attacks exploit the overall national and business organizations through malware, viruses and worms, faux websites, unauthorized net access, and
different means of accessing private and organizational data.
In the present time, cyber-hacks are increasingly being launched for socio-political gains.
Mobile networks, spanning over a large geographical area, the user is able to communicate from
any location because of wide cellular coverage. Determining location details of users requires
the use of software and also a prompt response as it changes rapidly. Mobile operators providing information services to users are vulnerable to nameless attackers who intend to abuse the
provider and their network. Common threats namely hacking of web sites, copyright infringement, and illegal communications exist. Mobile operators don’t have any predefined guidelines
to deal with such threats. Relatively simple solutions have been provided by Internet service
providers (ISP’s) which can be incorporated in the mobile environment. New threats exploiting
mobile network continue to appear. Detection of cyber-attacks help organizations in protecting
devices, apps and data from malicious attacks.
The results of data thefts from smartphones can be devastating and far-reaching. It can affect
people not only at personal level but also society at large.
