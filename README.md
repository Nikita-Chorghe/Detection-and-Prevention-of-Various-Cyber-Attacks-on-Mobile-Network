# Detection and Prevention of Various Cyber Attacks on Mobile Network

## INTRODUCTION

With a global increase in dependence on digital devices, there has also been a global increase in incidents of cyber-attacks on these devices, and with respect to such incidents, India has been no exception. Hence, it is the need of the hour to have a system in place that will not only detect but also ward off such attacks.
Smartphones connected to a network are vulnerable to a number of security threats such as malware that can easily breach the defense systems of IOS and Androids. Hence, an in-build strong defense mechanism is crucial to protect security breaches and prevent data and monetary thefts. Solely solutions capable of analyzing behavior at every layer for indications of attacks can protect the devices effectively. Attacks exploit the overall national and business organizations through malware, viruses and worms, faux websites, unauthorized net access, and
different means of accessing private and organizational data.
In the present time, cyber-hacks are increasingly being launched for socio-political gains.
Mobile networks, spanning over a large geographical area, the user is able to communicate from
any location because of wide cellular coverage. Determining location details of users requires
the use of software and also a prompt response as it changes rapidly. Mobile operators providing information services to users are vulnerable to nameless attackers who intend to abuse the
provider and their network. Common threats namely hacking of web sites, copyright infringement, and illegal communications exist. Mobile operators don’t have any predefined guidelines
to deal with such threats. Relatively simple solutions have been provided by Internet service
providers (ISP’s) which can be incorporated in the mobile environment. New threats exploiting
mobile network continue to appear. Detection of cyber-attacks help organizations in protecting
devices, apps and data from malicious attacks.
The results of data thefts from smartphones can be devastating and far-reaching. It can affect
people not only at personal level but also society at large.

## Objective

Every business organization or individual user is a part of the network. These organizations
and individuals are constantly endangered by cyber attacks. Cyber risks pose horrifying threats
to them with increasing financial frauds and Cyber terrorist act. Governments, multi-national
corporations, people face persistent threats, experience frauds, extortion and defacing of vital
IT infrastructure. With increasing use of smartphones, threats have also increased. Business
organizations and individuals face huge losses due to hacking or malicious attack. Thus it
becomes necessary to detect and prevent these attacks to make the mobile connection secure. It
is a necessity to provide a secure environment to mobile users.

## Problem Statement

Any attack launched on a any computer or mobile network with the intention of gaining
unauthorized access for ulterior motives like stealing data or money, stalking, breaching privacy
etc. can be labelled as a cyber-attack. Such attacks can be launched using viruses, worms,
backdoor traps, malwares, etc. Such attacks can threaten and cause serious damage to everyone
at personal, corporate, social, political, or national levels. Hackers can steal vital data and sell
it to rivals on dark web.
Mobile devices being portable, multi-functional etc, the number of cell phone users are
ever increasing. Thus there is a great need of mobile security. Taking into consideration these
points, a system will be developed to make it easier for the users to detect different threats and
efficiently avoid those risks.
